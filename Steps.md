Goal?
Set up a supervised classiefier for mouse USVs. 


Training works but issues with the actual classifier. 

Triying to do USV and call classification. 

User error 

I tried the unsupervised version, but for both supervised and unsupervised clustering, I get to the point where the call clusters come up and I can accept/reject/rename them, but after that,Â running other audio/detection files through the model doesn't work. 

Technical Error

Variable wind is not found..... 
Steps?
